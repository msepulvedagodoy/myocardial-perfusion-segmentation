# Myocardial Perfusion Segmentation
Automatic segmentation of myocardial perfusion in cardiac magnetic resonance images. We propose a solution for semantic segmentation in cardiac MRI.
  
  We implement the following dashboard in Weight and Biases for show our results in this task: 
  
  With the following Google Colabs, you can make a inference in myocardial perfusion images:
